# Sudoku-Solver
This project opens a text file with a sudoku puzzle (9x9, values separated with whitespace, 0 for empty values) and attempts to find a solution based on a simple algorithm. The program can detect whether or not a puzzle is impossible, and if it is possible, it will return a possible solution.
